# Coding for Calculus:

Have you ever wanted to learn how to program a computer or phone? How about how a computer can guide a robot? What about how the equations from your math classes can be used to simulate physics to understand the world around us?

During Coding for Calculus, we will be learning Python and using it like scientists and engineers. We will have a short session at the end of Fall to learn the basics, culminating in a guided final project, and then in the Spring we will use python on a variety of special topics, including robotics, probability and simulation. 

### What to Know:
* What you’ll need: We will be using Google Colab to run all of our programs so you just need a computer that can connect to the internet and a google account. 
* When we’ll meet: We will meet Saturdays 11:00 AM – 1:00 PM unless there is a better time. 
* What we expect from you: You will need to attend the weekly meetings and complete the guided final project. There will be undergraduate mentors from Northeastern to help you with the project, and there will be time during class to work on it. There will be some optional homework, but homework can also be completed in class.

You don’t need any programming background, but if you have it, there will still be a lot to learn!
